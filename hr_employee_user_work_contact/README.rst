=============================
HR Employee User Work Contact
=============================

In Odoo 16, saving an employee creates a work contact. The *Create User* action
of the employee form then creates a second contact for the new user and links
the employee to it, so the first contact is left orphaned and duplicated.

This module makes the *Create User* action reuse the work contact of the
employee, so that only one contact exists for the employee and its user. If
that contact already belongs to another user, a new contact is created as usual.
